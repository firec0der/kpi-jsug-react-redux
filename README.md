This is the small app that was developed during one night.

The app was developed for short lecture about React and Redux (The meetup was there -> [click me](http://dou.ua/calendar/10102/) (Russian, Ukrainian)). Actually, it's my slides and examples of code.

As always, `clone`, `npm i`, `npm start` `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Based on [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot). Tested with `node 5.5.0`
