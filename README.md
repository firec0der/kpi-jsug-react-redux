This is a small app that was developed in one night.

Hosted [here](http://itkpi.github.io/jsug/share/1-meetup/1-ivan-stetsenko-react-redux/).

The app was developed for a short lecture about React and Redux (The meetup was here -> [click me](http://dou.ua/calendar/10102/) (Russian, Ukrainian)). Actually, these are my slides and examples of code.

As always, `clone`, `npm i`, `npm start` `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Based on [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot). Tested with `node 5.5.0`

P.S Slides order is broken [here](https://github.com/firec0der/kpi-jsug-react-redux/tree/master/src/constants/slides) and [here](https://github.com/firec0der/kpi-jsug-react-redux/blob/master/src/constants/slides.js#L38-L54). I'm lazy and someday I'll fix it. Maybe :)
